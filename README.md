# 📍 Condition Based Maintenance of Naval Propulsion Plants Using Machine Learning

The algorithms used in this prediction are the regression algorithms, such as XGBoost regressor, Multiple Linear Regression, and RandomForest regressor. Usually, the dataset is full of noise and redundancy, for that some preprocessing techniques have been applied for the preparation of data. The models embedded with algorithms have gone through some  hyperparameter tuning so as to express their best performance with the tuned and appropriate parameters.
#### About Dataset

The features of this dataset carries important information such as the GT compression coefficients, level position, ship speed, gas generation rate, fuel rate, etc on the basis of which the task is to calculate the GT turbine coefficients of different observations taken in different scenarios.
